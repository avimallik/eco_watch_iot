## Project Summary – Eco Watch IoT

Eco Watch IoT is an IoT-based environmental hazard detection and automation system designed to enhance safety in sensitive environments such as banks. The system focuses on detecting high temperature and gas or smoke leakage using MQ2 and DHT-22 sensors and temperature monitoring.

A Flutter-based mobile application serves as the central monitoring platform. It continuously receives sensor data, detects hazardous conditions, and instantly sends alerts to security guards or responsible personnel to enable quick response and preventive action.

The application also provides activity reports that display detected events and sensor data history, helping authorities monitor risks, analyze environmental conditions, and improve overall safety management.

## 🏗️ System Design

### 🌐 Dashboard (Spring Boot App)
The web-based dashboard is developed using Spring Boot and is mainly used by administrators for system configuration and monitoring.

- **Threshold Configuration**
  - Admin can set temperature thresholds for the DHT-22 sensor.
  - Admin can input MQ2 gas/smoke PPM threshold values.

- **Save ESP IP**
  - Users can store the IP address generated by the WeMos D1 / ESP IoT module for communication.

- **Detection Report**
  - Displays detailed reports of detected hazards.
  - Shows date and time of high temperature and smoke/gas detection events.

- **Register**
  - Security guards and safety personnel working in the bank can be registered.
  - All registration information is securely stored in an Oracle Database.

### 📱 Eco Watch Client (Flutter App)
Eco Watch Client is a Flutter-based mobile application installed on the smartphones of security personnel for real-time monitoring and alerts.

- **Dashboard**
  - Displays current MQ2 gas PPM, DHT-22 temperature, and humidity values.
  - Shows configured threshold values for MQ2 PPM and temperature.

- **Continuous Alarm System**
  - If MQ2 PPM or temperature exceeds the defined threshold, a continuous alarm is triggered.
  - The alarm will not stop until the **STOP** button is pressed.

- **Detection Report**
  - Shows reports of detected high smoke/gas and temperature events.
  - Includes exact date and time of each detected hazard.
